# Practical Machine Learning Programming Assignment

Using devices such as *Jawbone Up*, *Nike FuelBand*, and *Fitbit* it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. The goal of the project is to quantify how well six participants performed the barbell lifts based on the data collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of these participants. More information about the dataset is available from this link: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har and the following publication:
